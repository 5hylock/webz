Thanks to peer pressure and the need to add content to this website, I have decided to rub my last 2 brain cells together to memorialize this average, totally-not-special-in-any-way year. Welcome to the most uneventful year in review you\u0026rsquo;ve ever read !\nThe first 75% -\u0026gt; living in school I had the \u0026ldquo;privilege of lots of free time\u0026rdquo; during this part of the year (also known as frictional unemployment, but i\u0026rsquo;m a glass half full kinda guy). Here are the good results of that:\nThis allowed me to spend some time volunteering with a student run organization through which I was able to meet some very cool people and learn how to function in a technical capacity within a collaborative setting with non technical colleagues. I was able to use this time to finally get my COMPTIA SECURITY+ certification which eluded me in the past year due to a larger workload and more responsibilities. I also worked on a bunch of projects with some super smart individuals and participated (and kicked ass) in cybersecurity competitions at both international and local levels sometimes with my epic team M4X_HE4DR00M (waddup bois !) and sometimes solo. I took deeper interest in my school work and focused on becoming a better student which led to me being able to maintain an excellent academic performance. I SERIOUSLY improved my knowledge of python and became a better programmer. I pulled off some of the most daring and well orchestrated rick rolls that I have ever done and impressed myself to the chagrin of my friends (one person in particular who shall not be named in this post in order to prevent harassment from my vast audience), acquaintances and random strangers on the internet. I got some nice real world hacks under my belt that I\u0026rsquo;m unable to talk about in detail. It wasn\u0026rsquo;t all smooth sailing though, the first bunch of months also had some negative experiences:\nI eventually ran out of things to do that matched up with my long term goals and fell into an existential crisis coupled with a deep depression that resulted in me being completely lost for a while. I ended up wasting months on confused pursuits without any endgame or plan. I had fun with some of these endeavours and sucked at most of them but i was able to come out of this experience with a deeper understanding of myself and my interests. I became deeply broke \u0026hellip; The last 25% -\u0026gt; moved back home Moving back home was a hard decision for me because I already got used to independent living and operating on my own schedule, but the fresh sapa (suffering, to the uninitiated) that i would have experienced would have been a lot harder than that. This period also had its ups :\nI got multiple jobs and became financially stable during this period I was able to become a mentor to a very bright young programmer and help with his project about game playing algorithms. Bonded further with my teammates in M4X_HE4DR00M. We had events like gaming evenings (Brawlhalla, Rogue Company, Naraka Bladepoint) and so many Spotify sessions that my Spotify annual report was greatly skewed by the genres that were introduced to me. I won even more competitions with my team. I had some fruitful investments and gained a better understanding of the value of money (I still think it\u0026rsquo;s overrated). I made a blog that has 2 posts so far (including this one). Hopefully, you\u0026rsquo;re reading this in a future where this site has become significant enough to validate its existence. and downs:\nI was working multiple jobs simultaneously while handling school full time (bad idea) which impacted my social life, health and ability to focus on my academics. I managed to maintain my GPA but it was a very close call. I developed a terrible spending habit in the first few weeks of actually having income. I think I rationalized it as planning ahead for another round of \u0026ldquo;privilege of lots of free time\u0026rdquo;. I beat this eventually. more depression (what can I say ?, I\u0026rsquo;m a sad boi). This was totally seasonal though. All in all, I learned new skills, met cool people, did cool shit and became a bit less broke and a bit less depressed. I\u0026rsquo;m excited to face 2022 and whatever problems it might bring. (I forgot like 90% of the stuff that I was planning to write)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s to a new year üçª\n","permalink":"https://integraloddity.com/posts/2021_in_review/","summary":"2021 is/was a year.

Being stuck on an unfamiliar device with none of the apps that I‚Äôm used to, I did a quick glance of the play store and downloaded the first app that looked like it didn‚Äôt have malware in it (as the competent security professional that I am.) and I ended up with Ilovepdf. Its business model is freemium with functionality locked based on amount of tasks performed per day and requiring payment for performing additional tasks.\nHere is an image of the paywall:\nI immediately decided that, since the paywall is locked behind tasks carried out ‚Äúper day‚Äù, the application might be using the system time of my device as opposed to contacting some API or server somewhere on the internet for the accurate time (this would require internet access for an application whose functionality is largely local and would reduce the application‚Äôs usability). This led to testing out whether changing my device time would impact the recorded tasks already carried out (surprise surprise, it did) In effect, I was able to use the application an unlimited amount of times without paying for additional access just by disabling automatic date and time setting on the android device and changing the day to one not used before.\nHere is a video detailing the entire process.\nI know this is not the most earth shattering bug, but it leads to a discussion of what is perhaps my favourite bug type: business logic bypass.\nExplaining business logic vulnerabilities According to OWASP\n\u0026hellip; business logic vulnerabilities are ways of using the legitimate processing flow of an application in a way that results in a negative consequence to the organization.\nand according to Portswigger\nBusiness logic vulnerabilities are flaws in the design and implementation of an application that allow an attacker to elicit unintended behavior. This potentially enables attackers to manipulate legitimate functionality to achieve a malicious goal. These flaws are generally the result of failing to anticipate unusual application states that may occur and, consequently, failing to handle them safely.\nIt involves fully understanding the underlying business rules behind an application\u0026rsquo;s functionality and manipulating them to achieve some unforseen goals (presumably malicious) that the application cannot defend itself against. The beauty of this vulnerability type is the fact that it does not require sophisticated technical knowledge or complicated automated tools, all you need is a good eye for detail and critical thinking skills. Also, the effects of business logic flaws range from mild annoyances to full application compromise. If you want to learn about business logic bugs and other interesting web security stuff, Portswigger Academy has a lot of comprehensive resources (for free !)\nTLDR; if an application locks functionality behind time based parameters, it‚Äôs always a good idea to test how changing your system time affects said functionality.\nHappy hacking !\n","permalink":"https://integraloddity.com/posts/ilovepdf_paywall_bypass/","summary":"Intro This article details how I bypassed the paywall present in Ilovepdf‚Äôs mobile application for the amount of daily PDF processing tasks possible and explains the specific vulnerability type involved: \u0026ldquo;business logic\u0026rdquo;\nStory Time A couple of days ago, I was helping my mom do some clerical work with PDFs (because I‚Äôm the good child and my siblings are useless).
