Okay, before we go any further, if you're someone with a business/collaboration proposal or you somehow missed my home page, you can download my resume [here](/my_resume.pdf). 

**So, who am I ?** My name is Emmanuel and I'm a I.T professional. My core area of expertise and actual profession is in Application Security Research, I have some experience in doing Penetration Tests, Code Reviews, Responsible Disclosures and submitting reports to Bug Bounty programmes so you can be sure that I don't know what I'm talking about. Currently, I work as a security researcher in a product-focused environment. In engaging with AppSec, I've incidentally tried my hands at fields such as Data Analytics, Cloud computing, Software Design, Web Development and Technical Writing :-). Besides the professional stuff, i enjoy gaming, reading and watching movies in my spare time.

**What's this site for ?** Thanks for asking, this website is meant to serve 2 different purposes:
- A general blog about life, cool accomplishments and anything interesting i'm up to. Content like this won't be strictly didactic. [blog link](/posts)
- An online archive to share some of the stuff that i'm learning with the general public as little notes and interesting finds distributed accross different topics. [notes link](/notes)
